But when we reflected that there was one Cyrus , the Persian , who reduced to obedience a vast number of men and cities and nations , we were then compelled to change our opinion and decide that to rule men might be a task neither impossible nor even difficult , if one should only go about it in an intelligent manner . At all events , we know that people obeyed Cyrus willingly , although some of them were distant from him a journey of many days , and others of many months ; others , although they had never seen him , and still others who knew well that they never should see him . Nevertheless they were all willing to be his subjects .",

Those in Europe , at any rate , are said to be free and independent of one another even to this day . But Cyrus , finding the nations in Asia also independent in exactly the same way , started out with a little band of Persians and became the leader of the Medes by their full consent and of the Hyrcanians by theirs ; he then conquered Syria , Assyria , Arabia , Cappadocia , both Phrygias , Lydia , Caria , Phoenicia , and Babylonia ; he ruled also over Bactria , India , and Cilicia ; and he was likewise king of the Sacians , Paphlagonians , Magadidae , and very many other nations , of which one could not even tell the names ; he brought under his sway the Asiatic Greeks also ; and , descending to the sea , he added both Cyprus and Egypt to his empire .",

And they bring one another to trial also charged with an offence for which people hate one another most but go to law least , namely , that of ingratitude ; and if they know that any one is able to return a favour and fails to do so , they punish him also severely . For they think that the ungrateful are likely to be most neglectful of their duty toward their gods , their parents , their country , and their friends ; for it seems that shamelessness goes hand in hand with ingratitude ; and it is that , we know , which leads the way to every moral wrong .",

And besides , they teach them self-restraint in eating and drinking ; and it greatly conduces to this also that they see that their elders do not leave their post to satisfy their hunger until the officers dismiss them ; and the same end is promoted by the fact that the boys do not eat with their mothers but with their teachers , from the time the officers so direct . Furthermore , they bring from home bread for their food , cress for a relish , and for drinking , if any one is thirsty , a cup to draw water from the river .
