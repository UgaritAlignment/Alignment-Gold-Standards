# Alignment Gold Standards for Ancient Greek

This repository contains guidelines and gold standard datasets for the alignment of Ancient Greek texts and translations in modern languages. The guidelines are currently developed for Ancient Greek-English and Ancient Greek-Brazilian Portuguese, and more will be added in the course of future work. 

The annotation style guide for Ancient Greek - English was developed by Chiara Palladino at Furman University (USA) and Farnoosh Shamsian at the University of Leipzig (Germany). The annotation style guide for Ancient Greek - Brazilian Portuguese was developed by Anise d'Orange Ferreira and Michel Ferreira dos Reis at UNESP Araraquara, Brazil. The guidelines were used to annotate a diverse dataset including Homeric epic, Attic prose, and Platonic dialogue, and were tested by measuring inter-annotator agreement above 80% on average. The Ancient Greek texts used are almost entirely available through the Scaife viewer (https://scaife.perseus.org/).

The datasets used to develop the gold standard were aligned using the Ugarit Translation Alignment Editor for Historical languages (http://ugarit.ialigner.com/), and they are available in this repository. 

The materials available here can be used to perform and evaluate alignments of various texts in Ancient Greek, to create new gold standard corpora, and to train automated translation models. 

The guidelines can also be further adapted to address similar language pairs including an inflected and a synthetic language, such as Latin and English, or can provide a structure for the alignment of other historical texts against modern translations. However, the guidelines are not project-specific: they were specifically intended for the creation of a Gold Standard in the scenario of machine translation. Different scenarios, such as language research or pedagogy, may need further tweaking to these guidelines to make them more compatible with different underlying principles.
